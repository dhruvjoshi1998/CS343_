class MLP():
    '''
    MLP is a class for multilayer networks with different loss functions

    The structure of our MLP will be:

    Input layer (X units)
    -> Hidden layer (Y units) with Rectified Linear activation (ReLu)
    -> Output layer (Z units) with softmax activation

    Due to the softmax, activation of output neuron i represents the probability that
    the current input sample belongs to class i.

    NOTE: We will keep our bias weights separate from our feature weights to simplify computations.

        Don't forget to add the regularization to the loss!

        NOTE: Implement all forward computations within this function
        (don't divide up into separate functions for net_in, net_act). Doing this all in one method
        is not good design, but as you will discover, having the
        forward computations (y_net_in, y_net_act, etc) easily accessible in one place makes the
        backward pass a lot easier to track during implementation. In future projects, we will
        rely on better OO design.

        Performs a backward pass (output -> hidden -> input) during training to update the
        weights. This function implements the backpropogation algorithm.

        This should start with the loss and progate the activity
        backwards through the net to the input-hidden weights.

        I added the first few gradients, assuming dz_net_act is your softmax
        activations. Next, tackle dz_net_in and so on.

        I suggest numbering your forward flow equations and process each for
        relevant gradients in reverse order until you hit the first set of weights.

        (1) hidden wts, (2) hidden bias, (3) output weights, (4) output bias

        reg: float. Regularization strength used when computing the loss and gradient.
