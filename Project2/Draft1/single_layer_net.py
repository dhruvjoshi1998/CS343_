        features: ndarray. shape=(Num samples, num features)

        n_epochs: int. Number of training epochs
        lr: float. Learning rate
        mini_batch_sz: int. Batch size per training iteration. 
            i.e. Chunk this many data samples together to process with the model per training
            iteration. Then we do gradient descent and update the wts. NOT the same thing as an epoch.
        reg: float. Regularization strength used when computing the loss and gradient.
        verbose: int. 0 means no print outs. Any value > 0 prints Current iteration number and
            training loss every 100 iterations.

        Returns:
        -----------
        loss_history: Python list of floats. Recorded training loss on every mini-batch / training
            iteration.

        NOTE:
        - Recall: training epoch is not the same thing as training iteration with mini-batch.
        If we have mini_batch_sz = 100 and N = 1000, then we have 10 iterations per epoch. Epoch
        still means entire pass through the training data "on average".

                - You may need a sign flip in the update rule compared to Project 1
                  (use the "vanilla" gradient descent equation). Reason for this is that we are
                  supporting multiple net activation functions and don't want to make assumptions

        f_z: ndarray. net_act transformed by softmax function. shape=(N, C)

        Tips:
        -----------
        - Remember the adjust-by-the-max trick (for each input samp) to prevent numeric overflow!
        This will make the max net_in value for a given input 0.
        - np.sum and np.max have a keepdims optional parameter that might be useful for avoiding
        going from shape=(X, Y) -> (X,). keepdims ensures the result has shape (X, 1).

        loss: float. Regularized (!!!!) average loss over the mini batch

        Tips:
        -----------
        - Remember that the loss is the negative of the average softmax activation values of neurons
        coding the correct classes only.
        - It is handy to use arange indexing to select only the net_act values coded by the correct
          output neurons.
        - NO FOR LOOPS!
        - Remember to add on the regularization term, which has a 1/2 in front of it.
