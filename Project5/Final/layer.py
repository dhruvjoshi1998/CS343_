        Hints:
        -----------
        Here is the general strategy for this method:
            - Maintain indices for the upstream (x,y) (d_upstream) position and another set for the self.input indices.
                Remember input_xy >= d_upstream_xy due to the pooling.
                Remember to update the input indicies using the strides, d_upstream indices increment by 1.
            - Find within each sliding pooling window position the INDEX of the most active input
                (when the network was running in forward mode).
            - Within the current window, we update the value of dprev_net_act, but only at the
                max index from the forward pass (i.e. the position of the input value that got thru during the forward pass).
                We -accumulate- the current d_upstream value here (not the input value).
            - If you use argmax, it results a LINEAR index, but it might be useful to have the corresponding SUBSCRIPT
                index. For example, if the 2x2 window is [[0, 1], [2, 0]], argmax will return 3, but we want (x, y)=(0, 1).
                Check out the provided helper function: ind2sub(self, ind, sz) to convert linear indices to subscripts.
